Deep and Machine Learning practice using R Studio where a large amount of datasets were analyzed to predict the detection of AD. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were three models that were taken into consideration through the RStudio software package with the utilization of a secondary dataset obtained from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL).
